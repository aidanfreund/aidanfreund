Hello, I am Aidan Freund, a student of general CS at Illinois State University.
My interests are extensive, which is one of the primary reasons I am pursueing a career in CS.  
I'm always trying to gain understanding of complex, and large scale systems, whatever they may be. 
I currently am seeking a professional internship that will help me better gauge where I'd like to start.
I'm interested in both software development and data analysis.

In school, I am currently learning concepts of programming languages, more advanced data structures and algorithms, as well as discrete math, and general physics

On here, I’m looking to collaborate on anything that peaks my interest.  Mostly rudimentary data analysis to develop my knowledge and abilities. 
I have some of my own ideas for project apps that I'd like to begin on here. Hopefully I can also contribute to some apps on F-Droid that I use.

Feel free to email me at aidanfreund@outlook.com
